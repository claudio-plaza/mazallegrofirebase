feat: refactor familiar form and optimize images

- Refactored 'AgregarEditarFamiliarDialog' to implement a clearer Add-to-List flow.
- Added visual distinction for the familiar form container (card style).
- Fixed 'ReferenceError' and logic issues in the dialog (state restoration, validations).
- Implemented client-side image compression in 'imageUtils.ts' and integrated it into familiar and document uploads.
- Cleaned up console logs across the application.
- Improved 'PhotoChangeCard' for admin dashboard.
- Removed process freezing issues by fixing form handling.
- Fixed compilation errors (escaped quotes) and lint warnings (hook dependencies).
