  Analyze the provided member data and identify members who may require updates to their status based on the following criteria:
  
  - Expired Medical Evaluations: Identify members whose medical evaluations have expired and suggest a status update to inactive until a new evaluation is submitted.
  - Account Inactivity: Identify members who have been inactive for a significant period (e.g., more than 6 months) and suggest account deactivation.
  
  Provide a list of suggestions, including the member ID, the type of update suggested, the reason for the suggestion, and the urgency of the update.
  
  Here is the member data:
  {{{memberData}}}
  
  Return ONLY the JSON object with the suggestions.`,
